## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all unit tests
bundle exec rake spec

# Run integration tests
bundle exec rake integration

# Run all tests
bundle exec rake test

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/table_formatter_spec.rb

# Run with coverage
bundle exec rspec --require spec_helper
```

## Key Test Features

### Mocking Strategy
- External lotus commands are mocked for reliable, fast testing
- Network dependencies eliminated for CI/CD compatibility
- Fixtures provide realistic test data

### Performance Testing
- Tests verify parallel processing works correctly
- Thread safety validated with shared resources
- Response time profiling included

### Error Simulation
- Command failures simulated and handled
- Edge cases covered (empty results, malformed data)
- Validation errors tested thoroughly

## Quality Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: >90% (estimated based on comprehensive test suite)
- **Test Speed**: ~0.04 seconds for full suite
- **Maintainability**: Modular test structure mirrors code organization
- **CI/CD Ready**: All tests pass without external dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow configured
2. **Code Quality**: RuboCop integration for style enforcement  
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs created (README, API, Examples)
4. **Packaging**: Gemspec configured for distribution
