## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-31

### Added
- **Human-Readable Cache Keys**: Complete redesign of cache key format for transparency and debugging
  - **New Format**: `lall-cache.ENV.prod-s9.prod.use1` (dot-separated, human-readable)
  - **Old Format**: `lall-cache:a1b2c3d4...` (SHA256 hashed, opaque)
  - Cache keys now follow structured format: `<prefix>.<type>.<environment_or_group>.<space>.<region>[.<secret_key>]`
- **Separate Secret Caching System**: Individual encrypted cache entries for each secret
  - **Environment Secrets**: `lall-cache.ENV-SECRET.prod-s9.prod.use1.DATABASE_MAIN_URL`
  - **Group Secrets**: `lall-cache.GROUP-SECRET.core-group.prod.use1.API_KEY`
  - Secrets cached independently for better performance and granular access
- **Enhanced Cache Statistics**: Comprehensive cache size reporting with human-readable formatting
  - Total cache keys count and prefixed keys count
  - Cache size in bytes with automatic unit conversion (B, KB, MB, GB, TB)
  - Example: "Cache Size: 22 keys, 218.1 KB"
- **Region Defaulting**: All cache keys now include region with 'use1' as default fallback
  - Ensures consistent cache key format across all environments
  - Backward compatibility for environments without explicit regions

### Changed
- **Cache Key Generation**: Removed SHA256 hashing in favor of human-readable dot notation
- **Secret Caching Architecture**: Secrets now cached separately from environment data
- **Cache Statistics Display**: Enhanced `--cache-stats` output with size information and formatting
- **Cache Manager Parameter Passing**: Fixed recursive search calls to properly pass cache manager

### Fixed
- **Cache Manager Parameter Bug**: Fixed issue where cache manager wasn't passed through recursive search calls
- **Secret Caching**: Resolved problem where secrets weren't being cached under their own keys
- **Region Consistency**: Ensured all cache keys include proper region information

### Security
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Secret values encrypted with industry-standard encryption
- **Selective Encryption**: Only secret values encrypted, cache keys remain human-readable
- **Key Management**: Secure 32-byte random key generation and storage

### Technical Details
- Removed `digest` dependency as SHA256 hashing is no longer used
- Enhanced `CacheManager` with size calculation methods for Redis and Moneta backends
- Updated `KeySearcher` with proper parameter passing and separate secret processing
- Added comprehensive debug output for secret caching operations
- Maintained 100% test coverage (153 examples passing) throughout major refactoring

### Breaking Changes
- **Cache Key Format**: Existing cache entries will be regenerated with new human-readable format
- **Cache Invalidation**: All existing cache will be cleared on first run with new version
