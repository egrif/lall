The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- **Export Functionality**: Multiple output formats with file export capabilities
  - Added `--format`/`-f` option supporting CSV, JSON, YAML, and TXT formats
  - Added `--output-file`/`-o` option to write results to files instead of stdout
  - CSV format: Comma-separated values with proper header row
  - JSON format: Hierarchical structure with environments as top-level keys
  - YAML format: Clean YAML structure for configuration management workflows
  - TXT format: Tab-separated values for easy parsing and processing
  - All formats support file output with success confirmation messages

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed NoMethodError in fetch_results_from_entity_set
  - Fixed undefined method 'results' error when using entity-based search
  - Implemented proper search logic that builds search data for each environment
  - Added proper integration between EntitySet and CLI search functionality
  - Fixed syntax errors and method structure issues in CLI class
  - Ensured all tests pass with 68 examples and 0 failures

## [0.11.2] - 2025-09-16

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed secret exposure with application flag
  - Secret values were not being exposed when using `-a`/`--application` flag with `-x`/`--expose` option

  - Added comprehensive integration tests to prevent regression

### Added
